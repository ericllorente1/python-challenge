## About
This sample project uses Python to analyze mass data from CSV files and exports a text file with the analysis report. 
## Intro Paragraphs
### Financial Profit Analysis
The Financial Profit analysis takes a company's month-to-month profits or losses over the span of the recorded time frame. The analysis will then calculate the total months, total net profit for the recorded time frame, and the average change from month-to-month for every month in the file. In addition, the analysis will yield the month with the greastest increase in profit along with its margin, and the greatest decrese in profit along with its respective margin. 
### Electoral analysis 
The Electoral analysis takes the voting information from a campaign to determine the winning candidate. The data includes a Ballot ID for every vote, the county where the vote was casted, and the candidated that was voted for. The analysis will yield the total votes casted in the election, the total votes casted for every candidate, the percentage of votes per candidates, and the winner of the elections. 
## Script Demonstrates How to:
*import csv library

*create/join path to a csv file
*read csv file
*write csv file
*create a With open loop
*create a For loop through every row in csv file 
*create and append lists
*extract unique values from a list using dictionary keys
*create a list of a dictionary's key values
*create a list within a dictionary 
*append a list within a dictionary using a for loop and if conditional statements
*find the length of a list
*use the round function
*determine the max value of a list
*determine the index of an element in a list
*export a txt file
*create a for loop in range of a list 
## User Instructions 
### Financial Analysis instructions
    1. Download zip file for repository or clone repository
    2. Click on PyBank to access the script for the Financial Analyis
    3. Open pybank_main.py in a vscode (or editor of choice)
    4. Make sure the working directory is under PyBank folder
